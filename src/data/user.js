			"The ROADII-Lab Code Catalog has been developed by the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) with the purpose of disseminating comprehensive information and resources pertaining to advanced data analytics use cases within the transportation domain. Given the continuous evolution of data analytics techniques, it is imperative for state and local agencies to gain a profound understanding of the relevant use cases, their implementation and operationalization possibilities, and the comparative benefits of various options. The solutions in the ROADII-Lab Code Catalog serves as an invaluable resource, empowering transportation practitioners to enhance the safety and efficiency of their transportation systems.",
